# Experiment 6

Evaluation of generalizability of MRD to various postures of mannequin. Used to generate Figure 17. In this experiment cross validation is performed for each T-shirt over 6 postures generating a set of 24 MRD models. The MRD models used to evaluate the results are generated as a preprocessing step. Please run models.ipynb prior to running this experiment.
