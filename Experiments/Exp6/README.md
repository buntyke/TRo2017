# Experiment 6

Evaluation of generalizability of MRD to various postures of mannequin. Used to generate Figure 17. In this experiment cross validation is performed for each T-shirt over 6 postures generating a set of 24 MRD models. This model training takes a long time (About 3-4 days). The same models are used to evaluate the results of Experiments 2,3,5. Please run this experiment prior to those experiments.

Please create folders in Results as the intermediate results are saved here:
