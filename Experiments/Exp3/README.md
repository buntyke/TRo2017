# Experiment 3

Comparison of various inference strategies for MRD. Used to generate Figures 12,13. The MRD models used to evaluate the MRD results are generated as a preprocessing step. Please run models.ipynb prior to running this experiment.

The python script `experiment.py` was written to remove the time overhead of running on IPython. However, this script was not used to generate the final results used in the paper. Please run `experiment1.ipynb` to generate the results for inference.
