# Experiment 3

Comparison of various inference strategies for MRD. Used to generate Figures 12,13. The MRD models used to evaluate the MRD results are generated in Experiment 6. Please run Exp6/experiment1.ipynb prior to running this experiment.

Please create folders in Results as the intermediate results are saved here:
```
$ mkdir -p ../Results/Exp3/
```

The python script `experiment.py` was written to remove the time overhead of running on IPython. However, this script was not used to generate the final results used in the paper. Please run `experiment1.ipynb` to generate the results for inference.
